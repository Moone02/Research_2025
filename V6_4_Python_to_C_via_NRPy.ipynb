    "The geodesic equation, as detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_equation), is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that relates the acceleration of a particle to the curvature of spacetime, represented by the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu}$):\n",

    "\n",
    "This cell sets up the foundational elements for our entire project. It performs three key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Import Libraries**: We import necessary modules from standard Python libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `sympy`) and the core components of `nrpy`. The `nrpy` imports provide tools for C function registration (`nrpy.c_function`), C code generation (`nrpy.c_codegen`), parameter handling (`nrpy.params`), and infrastructure management (`nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Directory Management**: A clean output directory, `project/photon_geodesic_integrator/`, is created to store the generated C code, ensuring a fresh build every time the notebook is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Physical Parameter Definition**: We define the black hole mass, `M_scale`, as a `CodeParameter`. This powerful `nrpy` object, found in `nrpy/params.py`, registers the parameter with the BHaH infrastructure. We use several flags to control its behavior:\n",
    "    *   `commondata=True`: This specifies that `M_scale` is a parameter that is \"common\" to the entire simulation, not specific to a single grid. As a result, it will be placed in the `commondata_struct` in the generated C code.\n",
    "    *   `add_to_parfile=True`: This instructs the build system to add `M_scale` to a default parameter file (`.par`), making it easy to change at runtime. This is handled by `nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH.cmdline_input_and_parfiles`.\n",
    "    *   `add_to_set_CodeParameters_h=True`: This is a crucial flag that enables the \"automatic unpacking\" mechanism. It tells `nrpy` to add an entry for `M_scale` to the `set_CodeParameters.h` convenience header. Any C function that includes this header will get a local `const REAL M_scale` variable, making the C code clean and readable. This is handled by `nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH.CodeParameters`."

It then defines the symbolic pseudo-momentum vector `pU` using `sympy`'s `sp.symbols()` function. Notice that we use \"direct naming\" here: the symbols are created with names that are already valid C array syntax (e.g., `y[4]`). This is a key `nrpy` technique that simplifies the final code generation by eliminating the need for string substitutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this function constructs the symbolic expression for the RHS. A direct implementation of the Einstein summation notation $-\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu} p^{\\mu} p^{\\nu}$ would involve a double loop over both $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ from 0 to 3. This would result in $4 \\times 4 = 16$ terms for each of the four components of $\\alpha$, which is computationally inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can significantly optimize this calculation by exploiting symmetry. The term $p^{\\mu} p^{\\nu}$ is symmetric with respect to the interchange of the indices $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. The Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu}$ are also symmetric in their lower two indices.

Since $\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{12} = \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{21}$, these terms are the same. We can combine all such pairs by summing over only one of the cases (e.g., $\\mu < \\nu$) and multiplying by two:\n",
    "$$ -\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu} p^{\\mu} p^{\\nu} = -\\sum_{\\mu=0}^{3} \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\mu} (p^{\\mu})^2 - 2 \\sum_{\\mu < \\nu} \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu} p^{\\mu} p^{\\nu} $$\n",
    "The Python code implements this optimized version. The outermost loop, `for alpha in range(4)`, iterates through each of the four components of the RHS vector we are constructing ($dp^0/d\\lambda, dp^1/d\\lambda, \\dots$). Inside this, the loop `for mu in range(4)` handles the diagonal terms ($\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\mu}(p^{\\mu})^2$), and the innermost loop `for nu in range(mu + 1, 4)` handles the unique off-diagonal terms (where `nu > mu`), correctly multiplying them by 2. This structure ensures that for each component $\\alpha$, the sum is computed with the minimum number of floating point operations, leading to more efficient C code."

    "This cell acts as the central hub for the symbolic portion of our project. In the preceding cells, we *defined* a series of Python functions that perform individual mathematical tasks. Here, we *execute* those functions in the correct sequence to generate all the final symbolic expressions that will serve as \"recipes\" for our C code generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"symbolic-first\" approach is a core `nrpy` principle and offers significant advantages:\n",
    "1.  **Efficiency**: The complex symbolic calculations, such as inverting the metric tensor and deriving the Christoffel symbols, are performed **only once** when this notebook is run. The results are stored in global Python variables, preventing redundant and time-consuming recalculations in the C-generating cells.\n",
    "2.  **Modularity**: This workflow creates a clean separation between the *specific solution* for a metric (the explicit formulas for the Schwarzschild Christoffels) and the *generic form* of the equations of motion (which are valid for any metric).\n",

This variable will be used exclusively by the `con_schwarzschild()` C code generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`all_rhs_expressions`**: This is a Python list containing the 8 symbolic expressions for the right-hand-sides of our ODE system. To keep this part of the code generic and independent of any specific metric, we create a symbolic **placeholder** for the Christoffel symbols using `ixp.declarerank3(\"conn->Gamma4UDD\", ...)`. This placeholder is passed to `geodesic_mom_rhs()` to construct the geodesic equation in its abstract form. This elegant technique embeds the final C variable name (`conn->Gamma4UDD...`) directly into the symbolic expression, which dramatically simplifies the C code generation step for the `calculate_ode_rhs()` engine."

    "### 5.c: The Main Integration Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python function registers the `integrate_single_photon()` C function. This is another high-level **orchestrator** that brings together all the components to solve the ODE system. It sets up, executes, and tears down the GSL numerical integration environment for a single photon trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated C code body performs several distinct tasks in sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **GSL Solver Setup**: It initializes the three core components required by the GSL ODE solver:\n",
    "    *   **`gsl_odeiv2_step`**: The \"stepper,\" which implements the specific mathematical algorithm for advancing the solution. We use `gsl_odeiv2_step_rkf45`, a reliable adaptive-step method known as the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (4,5) method.\n",
    "    *   **`gsl_odeiv2_control`**: The \"controller,\" which monitors the estimated error from the stepper at each step and adjusts the step-size to maintain a pre-defined accuracy tolerance.\n",
    "    *   **`gsl_odeiv2_evolve`**: The \"evolver,\" which combines the stepper and controller into a single object that manages the state of the solver between steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Define the ODE System**: The GSL library needs to be told what equations to solve and what parameters to use. This is done by setting up two structs:\n",
    "    *   A `gsl_params` \"carrier\" struct is created to hold pointers to all the data our RHS function needs (the `commondata` struct, `params` struct, and the `metric_params` struct).\n",
    "    *   A `gsl_odeiv2_system` struct is then initialized. This crucial struct bundles our derivative function (`ode_gsl_wrapper`), the number of equations (`8`), and a `void*` pointer to our `gsl_params` carrier struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Main Integration Loop**: The function enters a `while` loop that continues until a termination condition is met. Inside the loop, the line `gsl_odeiv2_evolve_apply(evol, control, step, ...)` is the call that tells GSL to compute the derivatives (by calling our wrapper) and advance the state vector `y` by one time-step (of variable size `d_lambda`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Store Results**: After each successful step, it stores the photon's new affine parameter (`lambda`) and position coordinates (`y[0]` through `y[3]`) into the appropriate arrays within the `path_struct`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Check Termination Conditions**: After storing the data, it checks for events that should stop the integration. This function needs `M_scale` for the event horizon check, so it uses the `include_CodeParameters_h` flag to make the `M_scale` variable available.\n",
    "    *   The photon's radial coordinate `y[1]` has fallen below the event horizon radius ($2M$).\n",
    "    *   The photon has escaped the simulation region by exceeding `r_max` or `t_max`.\n",
    "    *   The GSL solver itself reports a failure or the maximum number of steps is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Cleanup**: After the loop finishes, it calls the appropriate `gsl_*_free()` functions to release all memory allocated by the GSL components, preventing memory leaks."

    "2.  **Generates `metric_struct`**: It follows the same programmatic pattern to create the `metric_struct`, which contains 10 `double` members to hold the unique components of the metric tensor ($g_{\\mu\\nu}$).\n",
    "3.  **Defines Other Structs**: It defines the C `typedef`s for all other data structures (`Metric_t` enum, `metric_params`, the GSL \"carrier\" struct `gsl_params`, and the `path_struct` for storing results) as Python strings.\n",
    "4.  **Registers with `BHaH`**: For each `struct` or `enum`, it calls `Bdefines_h.register_BHaH_defines()`. This function, part of the `nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH.BHaH_defines_h` module, adds the C code string to a global registry. When `Bdefines_h.output_BHaH_defines_h()` is called later in the build process, it will automatically find and include all these registered definitions in the final header file."

    "### 6.b: Final Build and Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main execution block of the notebook. It brings all the previously defined Python functions together and calls them in a precise sequence to generate every file needed for the final, compilable C project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of operations is critical, as later steps depend on the files and registrations created by earlier ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Register All Components**: It calls all the C-generating Python functions that we have defined throughout the notebook (`register_custom_structures_and_params`, `g4DD_schwarzschild`, `initial_data`, etc.). This populates `nrpy`'s internal library with the complete definitions for all our custom C data structures and functions. At this stage, no files have been written yet; everything exists only in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Generate Parameter Handling Files**: It calls the necessary functions from the BHaH infrastructure to set up the parameter system:\n",
    "    *   `CPs.write_CodeParameters_h_files()`: Generates `CodeParameters.h` (which defines the `commondata_struct` and `params_struct` types) and `set_CodeParameters.h` (which contains the C code for unpacking parameters into local variables).\n",
    "    *   `CPs.register_CFunctions_params_commondata_struct_set_to_default()`: Registers the C functions that initialize the parameter structs with their compiled-in default values.\n",
    "    *   `cmdline_input_and_parfiles.generate_default_parfile()`: Creates the `project_name.par` file.\n",
    "    *   `cmdline_input_and_parfiles.register_CFunction_cmdline_input_and_parfile_parser()`: Registers the C function that reads the `.par` file at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Generate `BHaH_defines.h`**: It calls `Bdefines_h.output_BHaH_defines_h()`. This function scans `nrpy`'s internal library for all registered data structures (like `metric_struct` and `connection_struct`) and writes them into the master C header file, `BHaH_defines.h`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Copy Helper Files**: It calls `gh.copy_files()` to copy any necessary dependency files from the `nrpy` library installation into our project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Generate C Source, Prototypes, and Makefile**: It calls the final, most important build function, `Makefile.output_CFunctions_function_prototypes_and_construct_Makefile()`. This powerful function from `nrpy/infrastructures/BHaH/Makefile_helpers.py` performs three tasks at once:\n",
    "    *   It iterates through every C function registered with `nrpy.c_function.register_CFunction` and writes each one into its own `.c` file (e.g., `main.c`, `connections.c`).\n",
    "    *   It generates `BHaH_function_prototypes.h`, a header file containing the function declarations (prototypes) for all the generated `.c` files. This is crucial as it allows the different C files to call functions defined in one another.\n",
    "    *   It constructs the `Makefile`, which contains the compilation and linking instructions needed to build the final executable program. It is also configured to automatically link against the required GSL libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this cell is run, a complete, self-contained, and ready-to-compile C project will exist in the output directory."
