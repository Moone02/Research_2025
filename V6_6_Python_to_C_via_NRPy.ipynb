    "# Tutorial: A General-Purpose, Multi-Metric Photon Geodesic Integrator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Dalton Moone\n",
    "\n",
    "## This notebook constructs a complete C-language project that numerically integrates the path of a photon in various spacetimes. The project is designed to be a flexible ray-tracing engine, capable of generating lensed images of distant sources as seen by an observer near a black hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the project is the numerical solution of the geodesic equation, which describes the path of a free-falling particle (or photon) through curved spacetime. The geodesic equation, as detailed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_equation), is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that relates a particle's acceleration to the spacetime curvature, represented by the Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu}$):\n",

    "$$ \\frac{d^2x^{\\alpha}}{d\\lambda^2} = -\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu} \\frac{dx^{\\mu}}{d\\lambda} \\frac{dx^{\\nu}}{d\\lambda} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this numerically, we first convert it into a system of coupled first-order ODEs. This is a standard technique that makes the problem compatible with common ODE integrators like the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). We introduce the **pseudo-momentum**, $p^{\\alpha}$, defined as the velocity with respect to an affine parameter $\\lambda$:\n",

    "### The Reverse Ray-Tracing Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "To render an image of what an observer sees, we must trace the photon's path from the observer *backwards in time* to its source. While we could integrate with `dλ < 0`, most ODE solvers are designed to integrate forward with a positive step. To accommodate this, we perform a change of variables. We define a new affine parameter, $\\kappa$, that increases as the original parameter, $\\lambda$, decreases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\kappa = -\\lambda \\implies d\\kappa = -d\\lambda \\implies \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{d}{d\\kappa} $$\n",

    "This notebook follows a modular, single-responsibility design pattern. It uses the `nrpy` library to first define the underlying physics symbolically, and then automatically generates a series of interoperable C functions, each with a specific job.

    "# Step 1: Project Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell sets up the foundational elements for our entire project. It performs three key tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Import Libraries**: We import necessary modules from standard Python libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `sympy`) and the core components of `nrpy`. The `nrpy` imports provide tools for C function registration (`nrpy.c_function`), C code generation (`nrpy.c_codegen`), parameter handling (`nrpy.params`), and infrastructure management from `nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Directory Management**: A clean output directory, `project/photon_geodesic_integrator/`, is created to store the generated C code, ensuring a fresh build every time the notebook is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Physical Parameter Definition**: We define several physical and runtime parameters using `nrpy.params.CodeParameter`. This powerful object registers each parameter with the BHaH infrastructure, allowing it to be set at runtime via a parameter file (`.par`) or command-line arguments. We use several flags to control its behavior:\n",
    "    *   `commondata=True`: Specifies that the parameter is \"common\" to the entire simulation (e.g., black hole mass `M_scale`, spin `a_spin`). It will be stored in the `commondata_struct` in the generated C code.\n",
    "    *   `add_to_parfile=True`: Instructs the build system to add an entry for this parameter to a default parameter file, making it easy to configure.\n",
    "    *   `add_to_set_CodeParameters_h=True`: This is a crucial flag that enables the \"automatic unpacking\" mechanism, also known as the \"Triple-Lock\". It tells `nrpy` to add an entry for the parameter to the `set_CodeParameters.h` convenience header. Any C function registered with `include_CodeParameters_h=True` will get a local `const REAL` variable with the same name as the parameter, making the C code clean and readable. This is handled by the `nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH.CodeParameters` module."

Notice that we use \"direct naming\" here: the symbols are created with names that are already valid C array syntax (e.g., `y[4]`). This is a key `nrpy` technique that simplifies the final code generation by eliminating the need for string substitutions.\n",

This function is a prime example of a reusable component, as its logic is valid for any metric for which the components `g_μν` are known.\n",

    "2.  **Preamble Generation:** The function then programmatically generates a C code \"preamble.\" This preamble consists of a series of `const double` declarations that unpack the numerical values from the input `metric_struct` pointer and assign them to local C variables that have the *exact same names* as our abstract `sympy` symbols (e.g., `const double g00 = metric->g00;`).\n",
    "3.  **C Code Generation:** It calls `nrpy.c_codegen.c_codegen` to convert the symbolic `p0_expr` into an optimized C expression, assigning it to a temporary variable `p0_val`. This works seamlessly because the symbols in the expression (`g00`, etc.) now match the local C variables created by the preamble. This avoids the need for brittle string substitutions.\n",

This gives the function access to the `commondata`, `params`, and `metric` structs needed by our physics routines.\n",

It then calls our high-level dispatchers (`g4DD_metric()` and `connections()`) to fill these structs with the correct physical values for the current point in spacetime `y`.\n",
    "3.  **Call `calculate_ode_rhs()` Engine**: It then passes the current state vector `y` and the now-filled `g4DD` and `conn` structs to our RHS engine. This engine computes the derivatives and stores them in the output array `f`.\n",

    "2.  **Define the ODE System**: It sets up a `gsl_params` \"carrier\" struct, which holds pointers to all the data our RHS function needs (`commondata`, `params`, `metric`). It then initializes a `gsl_odeiv2_system` struct, which bundles our derivative function (`ode_gsl_wrapper`) with this carrier struct.\n",
    "3.  **Main Integration Loop**: The function enters a `while` loop that continues until a termination condition is met. Inside the loop, `gsl_odeiv2_evolve_apply()` tells GSL to compute the derivatives (by calling our wrapper) and advance the state vector `y`.\n",
    "4.  **State History and Event Detection**: The function maintains a history of the last three states (`y_c`, `y_p`, `y_p_p`). After each step, it checks if a plane-crossing event has occurred by looking for a sign change in the function `f(y) = x_cartesian(y) - x_target`. If a crossing is bracketed, it calls our `find_event_time_and_state()` engine to precisely locate it.\n",
    "5.  **Termination Conditions**: The loop stops if both the window and source plane events are found, if the photon hits the event horizon, escapes to `r_max`/`t_max`, or if the maximum number of steps is reached.\n",
    "6.  **Cleanup**: After the loop finishes, it calls the appropriate `gsl_*_free()` functions to release all memory allocated by the GSL components, preventing memory leaks."

    "    *   Next, it calls `cmdline_input_and_parfile_parser()`. This function reads the project's `.par` file and the command line, and it will **override** the compiled-in defaults with any values provided by the user at runtime.\n",
    "3.  **Setup and Run Scanner Loop**: It opens the `blueprint.txt` output file. It then enters a double `for` loop, iterating over a `scan_density x scan_density` grid of target points on the window plane. In each iteration, it:\n",
    "    a. Calls `set_initial_conditions_for_ray()` to aim the photon.\n",
    "    b. Calls `integrate_single_photon()` to trace its path and find plane intersections.\n",
    "    c. If both window and source planes are hit, it writes the mapping to the `blueprint.txt` file.\n",

This function, part of the `nrpy.infrastructures.BHaH.BHaH_defines_h` module, adds the C code string to a global registry.

    "4.  **Image Construction:** It iterates through the accumulators. For each pixel, if the hit count is greater than zero, it calculates the final color by dividing the total RGB sum by the hit count. This averaging step produces a smooth image, especially in regions where multiple rays from the observer map to the same pixel on the output screen. Pixels with zero hits are colored black.\n",
